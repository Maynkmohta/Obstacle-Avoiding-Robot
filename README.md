# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot
Obstacle avoiding robot using Arduino and Ultrasonic Sensor(HC SR-04).

For building an obstacle avoiding robot we need few materials mentioned below:

Material Required:

1. A chassis.

2. Arduino UNO (Brain).

3. Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04).

4. Bread Board.

5. Motor Shield.

6. Jumping Wired (Male-Female and Female-Male).

7. Screws.

8. 2* dc battery connectors.

9. 2* 9V Battery.

10. 2* BO Motors.

11. 2* Wheels for the chassis.

Working Principle of Sensor

Obstacle avoiding robot uses Ultrasonic sensor to avoid the entire obstacle coming in its path

with an Arduino UNO, a family member of Arduino used to obtain the wanted operation.

As the front of the robot is attached with an ultra sonic sensor so whenever the robot is going

on the path provided, ultrasonic sensor continuously transmits ultra sonic waves from the

sensor head. Whenever an obstacle comes in the path of the waves generated, they are

reflected back from an obstacle and thus this information is passed to the brain of our Robot,

Arduino. Now, Arduino controls the behavior of the motor based on the signals reflected.
